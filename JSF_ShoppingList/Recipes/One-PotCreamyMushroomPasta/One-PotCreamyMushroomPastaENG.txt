Directions
Add the oil to a large pot on high heat. When hot, add the shallots, garlic, and chili, and saut√© until lightly golden, about 3 minutes, adding a splash of water as needed to deglaze the pan.
Add all of the remaining ingredients to the pot, except for the spinach, and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer with the lid partially covered. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.
When the pasta is al dente, after about 12 - 15 minutes, remove from the heat and add in the spinach. Stir to combine.
Squeeze overtop some fresh lemon juice, sprinkle on thinly sliced basil leaves or some red chilli flakes if desired, and enjoy!
Notes
* If desired, the bouillon cubes and water can be substituted for equal parts vegetable stock.
Variations: add in some diced red pepper, artichoke, or fresh tomatoes.
