Directions
Preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C).
Cut the outer thick skin on the stem of the broccoli and discard. Cut the stem into little pieces. Cut the broccoli florets into bite-sized pieces.
Cook the pasta in salted boiling water according to package instruction. Cook until tender, but not quite done, ideally stopping about 3 - 4 minutes before the pasta is al dente. Add the chopped broccoli stem to cook with the pasta in the last minute. Then drain.
Add the pasta to a large 11 x 8 inch (28 x 21 cm) baking dish.
To a large bowl, add the coconut milk and hummus, and mix until well combined. Pour this overtop the pasta.
Add the broccoli and tomato, to the baking dish, and toss everything to coat.
Bake in the centre rack of the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, make the vegan Parmesan cheese by adding the cashews, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, and salt to a small food processor. Blend until a fine meal-like consistency is achieved.
If desired, although optional, add some of the Parmesan cheese to the top of the baked pasta and bake for an additional 3 - 5 minutes to toast.
Serve the pasta while hot, and sprinkle overtop more Parmesan cheese. Enjoy!
