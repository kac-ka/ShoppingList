Directions
Preheat the oven to 340°F (170°C) and line a baking tray with a piece of parchment paper.
To a food processor, add the oats, pumpkin and sunflower seeds, walnuts, pecans, cocoa, coconut, chia seeds and salt. Give it a few pulses to roughly chop the oats, seeds and nuts. If you don't have a food processor, you can also coarsely chop the nuts and seeds with a knife.
Remove the blade from the food processor. If the blades can't be removed, transfer the contents to a large bowl instead. Add the maple syrup, coconut oil, and vanilla extract to the nuts and seeds and mix using a rubber spatula.
Transfer the mixture to the baking tray and spread it out evenly.
Let the granola bake in the oven on the centre rack for 20 - 22 minutes, stirring halfway to ensure even baking.
Remove from the oven and allow the granola to cool completely. It will harden as it cools.
Once completely cool, mix in the chocolate chunks, and enjoy with milk or yogurt and fresh fruit.
